# RSA-Encryption-System
I have worked on developing the raw implementation of RSA without using any library. It uses modular arithmetic to deal with large numbers. The program is working efficiently for 1024 bits of prime numbers. I have also tried using FPM (fast polynomial multiplication) over FFT and integrated everything a the socket program.
